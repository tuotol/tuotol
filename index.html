          I shall maintain this site as a way to document the things I
          learn as I build some of the things I am currently building.

          These days, I am building a web application with React and Firebase. I shall
          regularly append to this record with short long paragraphs. This is easier than
          setting up a blog. This is also an attempt to reduce the friction that leads to me
          not writing at all and consequently not keeping records of the kind I just described;
          something I have been trying to do consistently.
          I will probably add some styling later when I develop a consistent habit.

          For now, the picture of apartment below is the best description of what this site is.
          Enjoy!
