          The project I am currently working is leading me to learn 3 things, React, Firebase 
          and consequently GCP products and finally reactive systems (this is why I am reading Reactive Design 
          Patterns by Roland Kuhn). I am building a payment and fulfillment system that listens for messages 
          from a payments provider and based on the response, either
          <ol>
            <li>
              adds some digital product to a user's account, sends them an notification, and logs it in GCP Big Query for analytics, or
            </li>
            <li>
              sends the user a notification if the payment failed and then logs it in GCP Big Query
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          So far my solution involves the following:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Firebase Functions(an onRequest function that acts a web hook)
            </li>
            <li>
              Pub/Sub functions to handle the fulfillment of different groups of 
              products and sending notifications. I am also using Pub/Sub to set up 
              dead letter queues(dead letter queues are a data store containing any message 
              failures (wrong or unhandled event types, any event that leads to the system 
              throwing an error, etc)
            </li>
            <li>
              Firebase Cloud Messaging for in-app notifications
            </li>
            <li>
              Big Query for the analytics data store
            </li>
            <li>
              Cloud Events: This is a standard for describing event data in a common way, 
              across cloud providers, which is really sweet imo. I am using CloudEvents 
              Generator to generate a library for all the events I will be handling in this 
              system
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          I have some previous experience with Firebase functions so this is not a brutal an 
          experience as I thought it would. A second part of the project involves realtime data 
          updates and I suspect, this is where I will bleed. Until then, we charge.
