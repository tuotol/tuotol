      <h2>My intuitions about serverless</h2>
      <p>25th July, 2021</p>
      <section>
        <p>
          Whenever I write some code, two things are usually forefront in my mind â€” 
          Business Logic Ã¡ la direct value delivered to the customer or user, and 
          Site Reliability. Everything else is subservient to these two ends, from 
          code readability to the usual devops practices to company culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first time I deployed a serverless function, I felt a very delicious 
          rush. My immediate reaction was "Wow, this is so easy!". I started web 
          development around 2016 and right from the bat, I was overwhelmed by the 
          sheer breath of tooling I had to familiarise myself before I could deploy 
          anything non trivial. Serverless functions took a heavy weight off my 
          shoulders. I have not voluntarily set up a web server since the first time 
          I deployed a serverless function, except to learn FastifyJs and to sharpen 
          my familiarity with MongoDb (I love document databases. What is a table ðŸ˜…).

          What do I like about serverless functions? First, I like the clearer 
          delineation of concerns, between the areas, forefront in my mind when I 
          write any code(Business Logic and Site Reliability). My strategy is simple: 
          each function encapsulates one unit of business logic. Put another way, I 
          should be able to map each function directly to some value delivered directly 
          to the user, where user here is a person or some intermediate or hidden 
          software service. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Any sufficiently complex software system will need some notion of what is 
          an acceptable level of availability. When I think of site reliability I 
          think about availability and mean time to repair, fault tolerance(how do 
          make sure components of the system fail without the whole thing crashing). 
          I also think of three guiding principles: Eliminating toil, embracing risk 
          and transparent service level objectives. The point of this word salad is 
          that serverless functions make this significantly easier to reason about, 
          plan for and execute. Whether it is GCP/Firebease, AWS or Azure, transparent 
          SLAs from cloud service providers mean transparent SLAs for your system. 
          Monitoring and observability work is stripped to actual monitoring and 
          observability and much mundane setup and recursive maintenance work(everything 
          you build to maintain must in itself be maintained). Product teams can c
          onsequently move a lot faster.
        </p>

          Later I will add more writing going into more details about my intuitions 
          especially as update them with new experiences. My personal intuition is 
          that serverless is inevitable for the industry as whole. Most importantly, 
          I believe serverless significantly reduces the barrier to shipping quality, 
          resiliant code and software. Developers can spend more time writing business 
          logic and less time performing arcane swishes and swashes that only make sense 
          to the Guild of Software developers. Check out Firebase functions or AWS 
          lambda functions
